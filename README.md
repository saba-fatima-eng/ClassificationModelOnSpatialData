# ClassificationModelOnSpatialData
A machine learning model that is designed to classify satellite images into different categories. It uses a combination of image features and machine learning algorithms to make predictions about the class of each image.

The specific details of the model will depend on the characteristics of the dataset and the specific machine learning algorithm and architecture that are used. In the example code provided, a random forest classifier is used to build the model. Random forest classifiers are a type of ensemble learning algorithm that use decision trees as the base learners and combine the predictions of multiple trees to make a final prediction.

To train and evaluate the model, the dataset is split into training and test sets, and the model is trained on the training set using the fit method. The model is then evaluated on the test set using the evaluate method, which returns the loss and accuracy of the model. The confusion matrix can also be used to evaluate the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.
